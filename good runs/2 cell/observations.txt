adding inhibition to gap junctions makes highest firing rate (low conductance gj) higher and lowest firing rate (low conductance gj) lower. scales with inhibition size
increasing inhibitory conductance alone (no gap junctions) doesn't change much - might make firing rate a little lower?
if that's true, increasing inhibitory conductance with no gap junctions also decreases spike pair proportion a little (seems to correlate strongly with firing rate in this condition)
inhibitory synapses alone make firing rate lower than no synapses (duh) but don't really do much in response to shared input
in response to shared input, inhibitory synapse condition is same as no synapse condition. spike pairs go up quadratically from 5% to 100% as correlation in input increases to 100%

small inhib strength = 0.0187
large inhib strength = 0.2618

adding small inhibitory synapses to gap junctions increases the proportion of spike pairs but adding large ones decreases it
adding large inhibition maybe increases firing rate for 100% shared input, adding small inhibition maybe decreases it
adding large inhibitory synapse to gap junctions decreases initial spike pairs (no correlation in input) from 25% to 10%. adding small inhibitory synapse increases it to 35%. spike pairs still hit ceiling linearly as correlation increases though
