plan of attack:
*figure out what to do with s
*look upon actual voltage traces for the inhibitory tests, find patterns
	*where are the spike pairs going?
*run fft on sum of s values from all cells
	*we want to find relationship between inhibition and gamma. 
	*does inhibition decrease it? increase it?
	*what about input correlation, does that increase rhythmicity?
*think about why dendrites and soma are different
*papers to read: gamma, ermentrout-kopell


gap junctions are a decider/discretizer - turn hints of correlation into yes/no
this may be dependent on gamma, which beta can wash out

range-kutta?
why are dendrites and soma different? is it just strength? (if so can we just use soma?)
	how to test: get data for synapses onto soma. see what happens when you scale term down
gap junctions = ping rhythms?? inhibitory connection # = gj connectivity? (see if anyone has looked at spike pairs in ping)
	how to test: make a ping network
is rhythmic input more effective at rescuing firing rate? (optimal frequency)
	how to test: design rhythmic input traces at various frequencies
what effect does it have on output?
	how to test: need a bigger network... difficult
